In the context of the paper entitled "Systematic Literature Review on Neuro-Symbolic AI in Knowledge Graph Construction for Manufacturing," we address the research question: "For which manufacturing use cases are knowledge graphs constructed with neuro-symbolic AI?"

Knowledge graphs, which represent a collection of interlinked descriptions of entities – objects, events, or concepts – have become a pivotal technology in the field of manufacturing for organizing and managing knowledge. When enriched with neuro-symbolic AI, which combines neural network approaches with symbolic AI, these knowledge graphs can handle complex and uncertain data, learn from it, and apply logical reasoning.

Upon reviewing the current literature, we identify several manufacturing use cases where knowledge graphs constructed with neuro-symbolic AI have been applied:

    Predictive Maintenance: Knowledge graphs have been utilized to integrate heterogeneous data sources, including sensor data, maintenance logs, and operational parameters. The neuro-symbolic approach allows for the extraction of patterns and the inference of potential failures, leading to more accurate predictions and timely maintenance interventions (Reference A).
    Supply Chain Optimization: Neuro-symbolic AI-enabled knowledge graphs facilitate the understanding of complex supply chain networks by capturing relationships and dependencies among various entities such as suppliers, manufacturers, and distributors. This aids in optimizing logistics, inventory management, and production planning (Reference B).
    Quality Control: In quality control, knowledge graphs represent the relationships between product specifications, manufacturing processes, and quality metrics. Neuro-symbolic AI can infer the impact of process variations on product quality and suggest adjustments to maintain standards (Reference C).
    Process Optimization: Knowledge graphs can model manufacturing processes, including the sequence of operations, machine parameters, and output characteristics. Neuro-symbolic AI leverages this structured knowledge to optimize processes for efficiency, cost, and energy consumption (Reference D).
    Product Lifecycle Management: Knowledge graphs capture the entire lifecycle of a product, from design to disposal. Neuro-symbolic AI can analyze this information to improve design for manufacturability, predict product performance, and enhance sustainability practices (Reference E).
    Customization and Personalization: For manufacturers offering customized products, knowledge graphs can represent customer preferences, product features, and manufacturing capabilities. Neuro-symbolic AI can reason over these graphs to design personalized products that are feasible to manufacture and meet customer needs (Reference F).
