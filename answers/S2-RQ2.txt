Neuro-symbolic AI methods are applied in the knowledge graph construction process of Smart Manufacturing in several steps. Firstly, a large amount of heterogeneous data containing vast device information is obtained from the network. Secondly, the conditional random fields (CRF) algorithm is used to extract the entity name, product place, and company name of the device. Then, the relationship between the device entities is identified by calculating the similarity and Chinese syntax analysis. Finally, the shortest path optimization algorithm is used to calculate the similarity between nodes in the search process to achieve the recommendation of similar node information.
