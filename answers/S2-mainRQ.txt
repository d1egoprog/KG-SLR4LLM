Neuro-symbolic AI approaches play a significant role in knowledge graph construction for Smart Manufacturing. The graph neural network of symbolic AI has the advantage of naturally handling Non-Euclidean structure data format, which enables more interpretable manufacturing decision-making with augmented intelligence via integrating the merits of statistical learning with semantic knowledge and reasoning. This combination is a feasible answer to solve the challenges in the industry, as seen in several studies (Kosasih and Brintrup 2021; Zhou, Bao, Chen, et al. 2021; Zhou, Hua, et al. 2021).
