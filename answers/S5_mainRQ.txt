In the systematic literature review titled "Neuro-Symbolic AI in Knowledge Graph Construction for Manufacturing," the role of neuro-symbolic AI approaches in Smart Manufacturing is thoroughly examined. The integration of neural networks and symbolic reasoning—neuro-symbolic AI—provides a multifaceted framework that is particularly suited to address the challenges of creating knowledge graphs in manufacturing environments. The research collectively highlights several key contributions of neuro-symbolic AI:  
   
1. **Data Integration and Semantic Enrichment**: Neuro-symbolic AI excels in integrating heterogeneous and voluminous data from sensors, machines, and operational logs. Neural networks process and analyze the raw data, while symbolic AI imposes semantic structure, enriching the knowledge graph with domain-specific insights and ensuring data consistency (Garcez et al., 2022; Sarker et al., 2020; Sarker et al., 2021).  
   
2. **Incorporation of Domain Expertise and Reasoning**: The symbolic components embed expert knowledge and facilitate reasoning about the relationships between entities. This is crucial for tasks such as predictive maintenance, optimization, and complex decision-making processes (Sarker et al., 2021; Bianchi et al., 2021).  
   
3. **Learning, Adaptation, and Scalability**: Neural components enable continuous learning from data streams, allowing knowledge graphs to dynamically adapt to new information or changes in the manufacturing environment. This aspect ensures up-to-date representations of manufacturing processes and supports scalability (Hitzler & van Harmelen, 2020; Manago et al., 2021).  
   
4. **Enhanced Decision-Making and Human-Machine Collaboration**: By combining neural learning capabilities with symbolic reasoning, neuro-symbolic AI provides powerful tools for decision-making and facilitates better collaboration between human operators and automated systems. Knowledge graphs constructed using these methodologies support complex decision-making processes by offering both data-driven predictions and rule-based diagnostics, enhancing reliability and interpretability (Bianchi et al., 2021; Smith et al., 2021).  
   
5. **Interpretability, Trust, and Continuous Learning**: A significant advantage of integrating symbolic AI in knowledge graph construction is the enhancement of interpretability and trust. Manufacturing operations often require compliance with stringent standards and regulations, making transparency a necessity. Neuro-symbolic AI approaches contribute to this by allowing for traceable and explainable decision-making processes, rooted in both empirical data and logical reasoning. Additionally, these systems can continuously update the knowledge graph as new data becomes available or when operational adjustments are made (Goertzel, 2019; Garcez et al., 2020).  
   
In summary, neuro-symbolic AI plays a critical role in the construction of knowledge graphs for Smart Manufacturing by providing a framework that integrates and processes large scales of heterogeneous data, incorporates essential domain expertise, adapts to evolving environments, supports complex decision-making, and ensures interpretability and compliance. This synergy between neural and symbolic techniques addresses the multifaceted challenges faced in Smart Manufacturing, making it a promising area for further research and application. Future research could focus on refining these approaches to better handle specific manufacturing challenges, such as integration with legacy systems and data privacy and security management.
