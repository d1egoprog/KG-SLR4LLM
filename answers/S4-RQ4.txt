Neuro-symbolic AI has been applied in the construction of knowledge graphs for several use cases in the manufacturing sector.
1. Intelligent Manufacturing Equipment: A study by Tzu-Yu Chen et al. (2021) proposed a manufacturing equipment information query system based on knowledge graphs constructed using neuro-symbolic AI. The system uses the conditional random fields (CRF) algorithm for entity extraction and relationship identification between device entities. The system can return a relational graph node when a device name is input into the search box, showing its potential in facilitating information retrieval in intelligent manufacturing.
2. Production Decision-Making: Zhou et al. (2021) and Kosasih and Brintrup (2021) highlighted the use of neuro-symbolic AI in constructing knowledge graphs for production decision-making. They found that the graph neural network of symbolic AI can handle non-Euclidean structure data format, enabling more interpretable manufacturing decision-making by integrating statistical learning with semantic knowledge and reasoning.
3. Predictive Maintenance: Cao et al. (2022) proposed a knowledge-based system for predictive maintenance in Industry 4.0, where knowledge graphs constructed using neuro-symbolic AI play a crucial role. This system allows for the prediction and resolution of potential issues in the manufacturing process, demonstrating the potential of neuro-symbolic AI in enhancing the efficiency and reliability of manufacturing operations.
4. Process Planning in Additive Layer Manufacturing: Liang (2018) proposed an ontology-oriented knowledge methodology for process planning in additive layer manufacturing. The use of neuro-symbolic AI in constructing knowledge graphs can provide a structured and comprehensive representation of the manufacturing process, aiding in process planning and optimization.
In conclusion, neuro-symbolic AI has been used in the construction of knowledge graphs for various manufacturing use cases, including intelligent manufacturing equipment, production decision-making, predictive maintenance, and process planning in additive layer manufacturing. These applications demonstrate the potential of neuro-symbolic AI in enhancing the efficiency, reliability, and interpretability of manufacturing operations.
