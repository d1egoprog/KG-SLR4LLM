Recent research has shown that the graph neural network of symbolic AI is advantageous in handling non-Euclidean structure data format, which naturally handles the spatial topological dependence between timeseries data and device nodes. This technology can enable more interpretable manufacturing decision-making with augmented intelligence via integrating the merits of statistical learning with semantic knowledge and reasoning. The combination of statistical AI and symbolic AI technology is a feasible answer to solving the challenges in the industry. Artificial intelligence techniques such as distributed representation-based knowledge graph reasoning and graph-based knowledge graph reasoning have become a hot research topic. These techniques can handle large-scale multi-source heterogeneous data and generate structured knowledge. Based on the given context, it can be said that the common neuro-symbolic AI architectures in knowledge graph construction are graph neural networks and distributed representation-based knowledge graph reasoning and graph-based knowledge graph reasoning.
