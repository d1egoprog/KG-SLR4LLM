Common neuro-symbolic AI architectures utilized in knowledge graph construction include Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), distributed representation-based knowledge graph reasoning, and graph-based knowledge graph reasoning. These architectures have been extensively applied in manufacturing and production settings, aiding in the handling of large-scale, multi-source heterogeneous data and the generation of structured knowledge (Zhou, Bao, Li, et al. 2021; Kosasih and Brintrup 2021).
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are particularly advantageous for their ability to naturally handle Non-Euclidean structure data format. This characteristic enables more interpretable manufacturing decision-making through the integration of the merits of statistical learning with semantic knowledge and reasoning (Zhou, Bao, Chen, et al.2021; Zhou, Hua, et al. 2021).
Distributed representation-based knowledge graph reasoning and graph-based knowledge graph reasoning have also been identified as hot research topics in the field. These techniques are expanding the boundaries of manufacturing issues and have been recognized as critical technologies that bridge data intelligence to cognitive intelligence (Li, J. J., Zhou, G. H., & Zhang, C. 2022).
However, it is crucial to note that while these neuro-symbolic AI architectures provide significant advantages, they also have their limitations. For instance, traditional knowledge graphs, which are often the focus of these architectures, mainly target static data in specific domains. They often lack the exploration of evolutionary knowledge within a particular field. Nonetheless, recent research has suggested that EEG can handle regular evolutionary knowledge, demonstrating the potential for further advancements in neuro-symbolic AI architectures for knowledge graph construction (Hogan, A., Blomqvist, E., Cochez, M., et al. 2021).
