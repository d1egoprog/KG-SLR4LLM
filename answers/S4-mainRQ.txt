Neuro-symbolic AI approaches play a crucial role in knowledge graph construction for Smart Manufacturing. They provide a feasible solution to the challenges faced in the industry, particularly in handling complex, non-Euclidean structure data formats. The graph neural network of symbolic AI can learn production knowledge and convert it to an embedding for large-scale computing, making it possible to handle the spatial topological dependence between time series data and device nodes (Zhou, Bao, Li, et al. 2021).
In the context of intelligent manufacturing, knowledge graphs (KGs) serve as a key technology for cognitive intelligence, enabling the horizontal integration of intelligent manufacturing. The construction of these KGs involves the extraction of entity names, product places, and company names from a large amount of heterogeneous data, followed by the identification of relationships between device entities. This process utilizes algorithms such as the conditional random fields (CRF) algorithm, similarity calculations, and syntax analysis (Chen, Chiu, Bi, and Tsai. 2021).
Furthermore, these KGs can be used to build manufacturing equipment information query systems, where inputting a device name can return a relational graph node. The shortest path optimization algorithm can be used to calculate the similarity between nodes in the search process to achieve the recommendation of similar node information.
Neuro-symbolic AI approaches also find application in the creation of intelligent question-answering systems that can retrieve answers from the knowledge graph in human-readable text form based on user-input natural language queries. This involves named entity recognition for question identification, intention analysis for question understanding, and knowledge graph querying (Consoli and Vieira. 2019).
Finally, neuro-symbolic AI approaches have been used to establish KGs based on massive multimodal data, and to introduce a multi-agent reinforcement learning-based decentralized system to optimize the manufacturing process (Zheng, Xia, Li, Li, and Liu. 2021).
In summary, neuro-symbolic AI approaches are integral to the construction of knowledge graphs for Smart Manufacturing, aiding in the extraction and interpretation of complex data, the development of intelligent query systems, and the optimization of manufacturing processes.
