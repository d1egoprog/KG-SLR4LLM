In the context of the paper titled "Systematic Literature Review on Neuro-Symbolic AI in Knowledge Graph Construction for Manufacturing," we address the specific research question: "In which steps of the knowledge graph construction process are neuro-symbolic AI methods applied in Smart Manufacturing?"

Knowledge graphs in Smart Manufacturing serve as a structured representation of data and relationships within the manufacturing domain, providing a framework for machines to understand complex relationships and processes. The construction of a knowledge graph typically involves several steps: data collection, data preprocessing, schema design, ontology building, entity resolution, relationship extraction, graph population, and graph refinement. Neuro-symbolic AI, which combines neural network approaches with symbolic reasoning, can be applied to various steps in this process.

Firstly, during data collection and preprocessing, neuro-symbolic methods are not commonly applied as these steps involve gathering raw data from various sources and cleaning or transforming this data into a structured format. These steps are typically more about data handling and less about the application of AI methods.

In schema design and ontology building, neuro-symbolic AI can be utilized to infer or suggest possible structures or concepts by analyzing existing data patterns and relationships. For example, neural networks can process large amounts of unstructured data to identify commonalities that could inform the creation of a schema or ontology, while symbolic reasoning can enforce logical constraints and relationships between the concepts.

Entity resolution, which involves identifying and linking different representations of the same entity across various datasets, is a step where neuro-symbolic AI methods are particularly beneficial. Neural network models can learn from context and similarities in data to propose potential entity matches, while symbolic reasoning can apply rules to ensure that matches meet certain criteria, such as consistency with the domain ontology.

Relationship extraction is another critical step where neuro-symbolic AI can be applied. Here, neural networks can be trained to recognize patterns and contexts that indicate relationships between entities, while symbolic reasoning can help in validating these relationships against the domain knowledge encoded in the ontology.

Graph population is the process of adding entities and relationships to the knowledge graph. Neuro-symbolic AI methods can automate this process by using neural networks to propose new entities and relationships, and symbolic reasoning to ensure that they fit within the graph's existing schema and ontology.

Finally, in the graph refinement step, neuro-symbolic AI methods can be used to optimize and validate the knowledge graph. Neural networks can detect anomalies or inconsistencies in the graph, and symbolic reasoning can be used to apply domain-specific rules to correct these issues.

In summary, neuro-symbolic AI methods are applied in Smart Manufacturing knowledge graph construction primarily during the ontology building, entity resolution, relationship extraction, graph population, and graph refinement steps. These methods leverage the strengths of both neural networks and symbolic AI to enhance the accuracy, consistency, and efficiency of knowledge graph construction in the manufacturing domain.

To conclude, the integration of neuro-symbolic AI within these steps of knowledge graph construction is an emerging area of research, with the potential to significantly advance the capabilities of Smart Manufacturing systems. Further empirical studies and development of frameworks are required to fully understand and harness the benefits of neuro-symbolic AI in this domain.
