Neuro-symbolic AI methods are applied in several steps of the knowledge graph construction process for Smart Manufacturing.
1. Data Collection: The first step involves gathering a large amount of heterogeneous data containing vast information about devices used in manufacturing. This data is typically obtained from a network [1].
2. Entity Extraction: The next step is entity extraction, where algorithms like Conditional Random Fields (CRF) are employed. CRF is used to extract entities such as the entity name, product place, and company name of the device. This is crucial for identifying the relationships between the entities in the knowledge graph [1].
3. Relationship Identification: After the entity extraction, the relationships between the device entities are identified by calculating the similarity and conducting syntax analysis. This step is vital in building the structure of the knowledge graph [1].
4. Knowledge Graph Construction: In the construction stage, the entities and their relationships are mapped to a graph database like Neo4j. This graph database is then used to create a visual representation of the knowledge graph [1].
5. Information Retrieval: The final step involves querying the knowledge graph to retrieve information. For instance, when a device name is input into the system, it can return a relational graph node. In addition, the shortest path optimization algorithm is used to calculate the similarity between nodes in the search process to achieve the recommendation of similar node information [1].
Furthermore, neuro-symbolic AI methods have been used to create models that can learn production knowledge and convert it to embeddings for large-scale computing. These models are guided by the knowledge graph and can enable more interpretable manufacturing decision-making with augmented intelligence [2].
